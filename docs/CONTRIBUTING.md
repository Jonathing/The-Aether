# Contributing to The Aether
## Getting started for programmers
1. Install the latest 64-bit version of OpenJDK 17. Check out [Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/) for the relevant JDK build for your OS.

2. Install the latest 64-bit version of Git, which can be found on the [Git website](https://git-scm.com/).

3. Fork The Aether repository with the [Fork](https://github.com/Gilded-Games/The-Aether/fork) button in the top right of GitHub.

4. We recommend to use [IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) for contributions. Other IDEs may work but any issues or roadblocks will not receive support.

5. We recommend a Git client if you are new to contributing, however if you know how to use Git you can also use the [command line](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-basics/start-using-git.html). Some client options are:
   1. IntelliJ IDEA itself ([Tutorial](https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2020/10/clone-a-project-from-github/))
   2. [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) ([Tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/overview/getting-started-with-github-desktop))
   3. [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) ([Tutorial](https://help.gitkraken.com/gitkraken-client/guide/))
   4. [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) ([Tutorial](https://confluence.atlassian.com/get-started-with-sourcetree))

6. Clone your fork of the repository with Git (note: if using IntelliJ IDEA for Git, this will automatically open the project as well).

7. Open the locally cloned repository with IntelliJ IDEA and set up the project workspace.

   If you're not familiar with setting up IntelliJ IDEA for use with ForgeGradle projects, cpw has created a setup video on a few of the basics of ForgeGradle [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfmlNiHonV0).

8. Start developing!
